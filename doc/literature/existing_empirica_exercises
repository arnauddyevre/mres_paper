Description of existing empirical exercises

*Acemoglu and Azar (2020)
- Study the importance of new combinations of technologies in accounting for TFP growth
- "We use data from the U.S. economy from 1987 to 2007
in order to estimate the contribution of changes in supplier sets to industry productivity.
Our estimates suggest that new input combinations may account for between 40% and
64% of average industry TFP growth. Naturally, this exercise should be interpreted with
caution, since it relies on the simplified structure of our model, and the observed relationship
between new input combinations and industry productivity growth could be driven
by other omitted factors. Nevertheless, this illustrative exercise highlights that the contribution
of new input combinations to productivity growth could be quite important and
should be studied more systematically in the future." 

*Baqaee and Farhi (2020): Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium (QJE)
- Figure III: decompose markups in between (reallocation) and within (firm-level increase) firm changes. Just like in DLEU (no network)
- More network-based exercise: Decompose aggregate TFP growth into changes in allocative efficiency and in technology using the input-output network. and "We implement our growth accounting results to decompose
the sources of TFP growth as measured by the cumulated
distortion-adjusted Solow residual in the U.S. over the period
1997–2015, in the presence of these changing markups."
- They show that allocative efficiency happens within industry and not across, so dissagregation at the firm level is key.
- "Gains from eliminating markups". Calibrate model as in section IV and show that accounting for higher elasticities of substitutions (for instance between firms in a given industry as opposed to across) and intermediate inputs magnifies the losses from missallocation "we set θ = 0.5, θ0 = 0.9, and  =
0.2. We set η = 1,"
- "changes
in allocative efficiency due to reallocation have contributed positively
to aggregate TFP growth since the start of the sample. Intuitively,
the distance to the frontier has increased because markups
have become more dispersed over time."
- They don't consider the fact that longer supply chains and more clustering of the network contribute to higher allocative inefficiency.
- Take productivity and markups as endogenous

*Baqaee & Farhi (2019) Beyond Hulten's theorem
- Calibrate multi-sector model to see what the impact of sectoral shocks on several moments of aggregate GDP
- No markups, simply an example of the importance of non-linearities in matching aggregate TFP
