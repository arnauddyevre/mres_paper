	- Check Liu (2017): QJE (Tim Dobermann) -> Can't find it!
	- small players (likely below the threshold) are unimportant (Pete)
	- Relate network to elasticities
	- Use Melitz (2003) or Melitz & Ottaviano (2008)
	- Model the markups as firms investing in making their products less substitutable (invest in making sigma lower for their buyers)

Comments Xavier 07/03/2020
	- There are two ways to edogenise markups:
		- variable elasticity of substitution for consumers
		- Atkeson and Burstein (2008), keep CES but add strategic interactions between firms (game theory)
	- Need to endogenise markups at some point, to really make it an important contribution
	- See work by Raval (federal Trade Commission), which uses various variable inputs to infer a better measure of markups
	- Don't do comparative statics on markups, strange, do it on productivity increase instead
	- explore si il y a des markups plus importants dans des parties centrales du reseau
	- Skype with Francesco Nava

	- Use industry-specific price-deflator (see email)
	- Shut down markups to get an interesting counterfactual
	- Show extensive and intensive margins for descriptive statistics on links
	- Show extensive and intensive margins for the Pareto distributions
	- Before showing the weighted degree, show the simple unweighted statistic
	- Present the in-degree/out-degree dichotomy in terms of monopoly power/monopsony
	- Don't include financial firms
	- profits: they should not be rebated! If markups -> this is only a waste
	- Drop capital and labour (or keep only labour being supplied inelastically)
	- Start with a time trend in markups, endogenise it later
	- Nash bargaining, make the bargaining occur over the total slaes being supplied to the customer rather than generic sales
	- Show how markup correlates with the position in the value chain
	- Plot how many people I supply to versus how many I buy from
