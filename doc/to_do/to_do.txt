Potential titles
	- "Heterogeneous firms and markups in production networks"

Problem:
- Big threat from paper by B&F, which studies markups with input-output linkages BUT:
	- No dynamic evolution of the network
	- No modelling of endogenous choice of suppliers a la Acemoglu and Azar
	- Only secondary aspect of their paper. Surely can be improved
	- Rely on input-output matrices at the sector level

Refine:
- Overall research idea
- Three projects:
	- MRes paper: network and mark-ups (+inequality), time dimension is essential
	- Larger theoretical paper: different models of growth and technological change nested in network theory of growth
	- Tax evasion as a cause of the rise of profitability of big firms -> decline of dynamism
	(- Relate compustat data to Patents?)

Include:
	- Proof
	- Network growth, evolution of network over time
	- Inequality (heterogeneous agents)
	- Mark-ups or decline in labour share
	- Task-based model of technological change?
	- Graph with mark-up time-series from DL&E, compared with network adjusted measure

Organisation of work:
	- Work heavily on theory first
		- Find question that I want to study
	- Then produce stylized facts about Compustat network


Organisation of paper:
	I. Introduction
		Importance of mark ups for welfare and business dynamism
		Lot of attention recently
		This paper highlights channels through which mark-ups propagates (double counting?)
		Contributions:
			- Put in perspective result by De Loecker and Eeckhout
			- Theoretical contribution 1: Explain growth of mark-ups and core-periphery of the network jointly
							Importantly, we need to deal with directed network
			- Theoretical contribution 2: Present dynamic model of network formation related to economic fundamentals
							while so far it has been pretty static
			- Econometric contribution: network formation with truncation of edges


	II. Brief literature review
		Propagation of shocks on networks

	III. Model of edge formation related to fundamentals and markups
		We need to model the choice of suppliers (Acemoglu and Pablo Azar)
			- How rational decisions lead to more concentration in edges

	IV. Econometric decomposition of the evolution of mark-ups: network coumpounding versus greed

Empirical exercise:
	- Reproduce mark-up calculations with both techniques used in the De Loecker and Eeckhout paper
		- Costs shares
		- Control function approach a la Olley & Pakes
	- Put that n perspective in network formation model
